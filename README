Daniel Segundo - ACM Research Coding Challenge - Question #1

At first glance the question seems to be asking to find the number of clusters, which to me says
to find the total number of points. Looking at the .csv file, there are 151 rows, 150 of which correspond
to a unique point. Therefore, my solution is to import the .csv file and count the number of rows with data.

To solve:
  Import the pandas library (as pd)
  use pd.read_csv() to read the .csv file
  use len() to find the number of rows
  print the number of rows
